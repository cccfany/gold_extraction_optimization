# Gold Extraction Optimization – Zyfra  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on optimizing the production process of a gold mining company. The goal is to **predict the amount of gold extracted** from raw mineral characteristics and improve operational efficiency.  

Machine learning models were used to:  
- Analyze input data from the plant (raw ore).  
- Model gold concentration at different processing stages.  
- Remove unprofitable parameters to streamline and optimize production.  

## 🎯 Results  
- The model achieved performance with **sMAPE within the company’s required threshold**.  
- Identified the key variables influencing extraction quality.  
- Reduced resource waste and improved efficiency.  

## 🛠️ Technologies  
LinearRegression, cross_val_score, RandomForestRegressor  
Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.  

## 📊 Business Impact  
The model enables Zyfra to **maximize profitable gold production**, reduce operational losses, and support smarter decision-making in the plant.
